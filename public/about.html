<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Ankur Shinde, an undergraduate student at Savitribai Phule Pune University, pursuing a Bachelor's 
degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. My academic journey is characterized by a strong 
interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer science, alongside a curiosity about 
human behavior, the human brain, and various scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, 
chemistry, and mathematics.</p>

<p>Currently, I am enhancing my technical skills in Web Development, Machine Learning, Mathematics 
for Computer Science, Operating Systems, Computer Graphics, Data Structures and Algorithms, and 
Graphic and Video Design. This diverse knowledge base empowers me to approach problems with a 
multidisciplinary perspective.</p>

<p>In my recent projects, I have utilized HTML to create a Movie Ranking website and a Birthday Invite 
website. These projects reflect my foundational understanding of web development and my ability to 
create functional and user-friendly websites. The Movie Ranking website allows users to rank their 
favorite movies, providing an interactive experience, while the Birthday Invite website offers a simple 
and elegant way to send birthday invitations.</p>

<p>My long-term goals include securing an internship with a leading multinational corporation (MNC) 
to gain practical experience and insights from industry professionals. Additionally, I aspire to publish 
my own research paper in machine learning, contributing to the academic community and advancing 
the field.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I aim to start my own business focused on AI solutions, applying first principles thinking 
to innovate and solve complex problems. This portfolio showcases my current projects and serves as 
a testament to my dedication to continuous learning and excellence in technology.
